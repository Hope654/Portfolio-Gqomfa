         <h1><u>Biography</u></h1>
         <p>Sine is a vibrant young woman who's more into life than life into her,<br> she's perfectly rooted to hard work and also can differentiate between work and fun time.<br>
            Sine: I grew up in one of the busiest cities in South Africa, Jo'berg.<br> As a young girl, back then technology was never an "in thing" and nobody paid any attention to it,<br>
            people lived their lives not knowing that technology will take over,<br> by 2015 I realised my love for technology, for IT, anything to do with computors.<br> Luckily I was fortunate enough
            to have a small background in technology, knowing the basics of computors at a young age,<br> my love for technology then blossomed.<br> <b>IT WAS NEVER PART OF MY CAREER PATH.</b></br>

        <p>My vision is never to give up, make my dreams come true, it is to focus and create the life I desire, there's a saying that says "A lot of things<br>
           broke my heart but fixed my vision", this is to ensure that at times you need to be strong in order to make your life's visions true. My vision<br>
           is as clear as the blue sky, I want to change people's lives, I want people to see technology as something they cannot live without, well...<br>
           you cannot live or even survive without technology.<br> Technology is the <b>NEXT</b> big thing.
           My passion translates into a positive working relationship that reflects the true secret to my success<br> I believe a high-quality web design attracts customers and helps you close the sale gap, you are what you manifest.<br>
           <b>"THE SMALLER YOUR CIRCLE GETS, THE CLEARER YOUR VISION BECOMES".</b></p>
